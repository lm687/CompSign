Title: Study of mutational signatures using compositional data analysis (CoDA) techniques
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Lena Morrill
Maintainer: The package maintainer <lm687@cam.ac.uk>
Description: It is generally overlooked that mutational signatures are compositional in
    nature. It follows that their analysis warrants techniques alternative to euclidean
    space multivariate analysis. In this package we provide methods for testing for
    differential abundance in a variety of regression settings by using a Dirichlet-
    multinomial model with multivariate random effects.
