input:
	- matrix of counts (per mutational category), or matrix of counts/frations (per signature)
	- clinical data

output:
	- summary (highest signature, etc.)
	- relation between signatures
	- similarity between signatures
	- relation to clinical data
		- comparisons with logcontrasts
	- biplot (logcontrasts)
	- create summary markdown
	- correlation between signatures: with relative variance
	- regression/LDA
	- prediction: pg 110, 111

functions
- nmf can be a c implementation


other:
	- simulated datasets http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/data.html

Analyses to repeat:
- logistic normal regression with logcontrast as the regressor, as in http://ima.udg.edu/Activitats/CoDaWork03/paper_Thomas_and_Aitchsion.pdf
